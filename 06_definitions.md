## Definitions


##  Continuous Integration

> A development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.


##  Continuous Delivery
> A series of practices designed to ensure that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment and ensuring business applications and services function as expected through rigorous automated testing.


> Since every change is delivered to a staging environment using complete automation, you can have confidence the application can be deployed to production with a push of a button when the business is ready.


## Continous Deployment

> Next step of continuous delivery: 
Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. 


> Continuous deployment should be the goal of most companies that are not constrained by regulatory or other requirements.
